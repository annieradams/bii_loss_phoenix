# Biodiversity Intactness Index

## About
This repositroy contains a notebook bii-phoenix.ipynb analyzing data about a difference of the biodiversity intactness index in Phoenix, Arizona. 

## Visualization
After examining geospatial and tabular datasets, we create a raster of the BII in 2020 in Phoenix, Arizona. On top of this raster, we plot areas in which the biodiversity intactness index was greater than .75 in 2017, but less than .75 in 2020. 

## Highlights 
- Pulling biodiversity intacness index data from microsoft planetary computer 
- Using geopandas to combine different maps to the same extent
- Merging of raster and vector data
- Creating and customizing a raster map
- Utilize the Microsoft Planetary Computer
